# [ExtractionSummarisationList]

The following attribute enables users to see a list of strings which show extracted sentences which have been generated by the Extraction Summrisation Analysis feature, via the Text Analytics API which is part of the Azure AI Language Service.

The IList string property can be amended following generation of the extracted sentences. However, when content in the string properties which have the [ExtractionSummarisation] attribute are published again, the IList string property will be regenerated with a list of extracted sentences, based on the content in the string properties with the [ExtractionSummarisation] attribute.

Please add only one instance of the [ExtractionSummarisationList] attribute per content type derived from IContent (the base content type in Optimizely CMS).

The attribute may be applied to the following property types:
- **String:** List of String values which show extracted sentences generated from the Extraction Summrisation Analysis feature , based on content being published in string properties which have the [ExtractionSummarisation].

**Example of [ExtractionSummarisationList] attribute**
``` C#
public class StartPage : SitePageData
{
    [Display(
    GroupName = SystemTabNames.Content,
    Name = "Extractive Summarisation List",
    Description = "List used for the Extraction Summarisation feature",
    Order = 15)]
[CultureSpecific]

public virtual IList<string> ExtractiveSummarisationList { get; set; }
}
