# [ExtractionSummarisationList]

The following attribute enables users to see a list of strings which show extracted sentences which have been generated by the Extraction Summrisation Analysis feature.

Extractive Summarisation is a feature offered by the Azure AI Language as part of Text Analytics. When used, the feature produces a summary by extracting sentences that collectively represent the most important or relevant information within the original text which is being used for this. The features uses natural language processing(NLP) techniques to locate key sentences in the text being used for this.

The IList string property can be amended following generation of the extracted sentences. However, when content in the string properties which have the [ExtractionSummarisation] attribute are published again, the IList string property will be regenerated with a list of extracted sentences, based on the content in the string properties with the [ExtractionSummarisation] attribute.

Please add only one instance of the [ExtractionSummarisationList] attribute per content type derived from IContent (the base content type in Optimizely CMS).

The attribute may be applied to the following property types:
- **String:** List of String values which show extracted sentences generated from the Extraction Summrisation Analysis feature , based on content being published in string properties which have the [ExtractionSummarisation].
