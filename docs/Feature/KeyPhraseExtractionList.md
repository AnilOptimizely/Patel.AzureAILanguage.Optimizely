# [KeyPhraseExtractionList]

The following attribute enables users to see a list of strings which show key phrases which have been generated by the Key Phrase Extraction Analysis feature, via the Text Analytics API which is part of the Azure AI Language Service.

The IList string property can be amended following generation of the linked entities. 
However, when content in the string properties, which have the [KeyPhraseExtraction] attribute are published again, 
the IList string property will be regenerated with a list of linked entities , 
based on the content in the string properties with the [KeyPhraseExtraction] attribute.

Please add only one instance of the [KeyPhraseExtractionList] attribute per content type derived from IContent 
(the base content type in Optimizely CMS).

The attribute may be applied to the following property types:
- **String:** List of String values which show key phrases generated from the Key Phrase Extraction Analysis feature , based on content being published in string properties which have the [KeyPhraseExtraction] attribute.
